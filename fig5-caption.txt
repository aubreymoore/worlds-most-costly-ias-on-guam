The 10 costliest taxa from the most robust subset of the original database for both cumulative damage and management costs (in billions of 2017 US dollars) between 1970 and 2017.Mixed costs are cost estimates for which the specific monetary contribution of damage and management costs could not be disentangled from the reporting studies. Each bar represents a species or a complex of species (when different species were often considered simultaneously to provide cost estimates). Numbers below the bars indicate the number of cost estimates. This ranking illustrates the limits of the available data and the need for more thorough and standardized cost reports (Supplementary Discussion 1). All animal silhouettes were obtained from an open source platform (http://phylopic.org/). The silhouette of Coptotermes was created by Melissa Broussard.
