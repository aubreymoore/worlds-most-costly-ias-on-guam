<h1>Status of the World's Most Costly Invasive Species on Guam</h1>
<p><strong><a href="mailto://aubreymoore@triton.uog.edu">Aubrey Moore</a>, University of Guam</strong></p>
<p>On March 21, 2021, Diagne et al. published an article in <em>Nature</em> entitled <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03405-6"><em>Status of the World's Most Costly Invasive Species</em></a>. In this article, they presented a figure showing costs associated with ten of the most costly taxa of invasive species, which includes seven insects, two mammals and one snake (You guessed it. It's the brown treesnake.) </p>
<p>Below, I have annotated their figure to indicate which taxa occur on Guam.</p>

<h3>Figure 5 from <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03405-6">Diagne et al. 2021</a>, annotated by Moore to indicate occurrence on Guam.</h3>

<p><strong>Fig. 5</strong> The 10 costliest taxa from the most robust subset of the original database for both cumulative damage and management costs (in billions of 2017 US dollars) between 1970 and 2017. Mixed costs are cost estimates for which the specific monetary contribution of damage and management costs could not be disentangled from the reporting studies. Each bar represents a species or a complex of species (when different species were often considered simultaneously to provide cost estimates). Numbers below the bars indicate the number of cost estimates. This ranking illustrates the limits of the available data and the need for more thorough and standardized cost reports (Supplementary Discussion 1). All animal silhouettes were obtained from an open source platform (http://phylopic.org/). The silhouette of <em>Coptotermes</em> was created by Melissa Broussard.</p>
<p><strong>GU</strong> indicates that a taxon occurs on Guam.</p>

<h3>Taxon Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aedes"><em>Aedes</em> spp.</a> Members of the genus <em>Aedes</em> are known vectors for numerous viral infections. The two most prominent species that transmit viruses are <em>A. aegypti</em> and <em>A. albopictus,</em> which transmit the viruses that cause dengue fever, yellow fever, West Nile fever, chikungunya, eastern equine encephalitis, and Zika virus, along with many other, less notable diseases. A search of the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) database indicates that there are four species of <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes currently on Guam: <em>A. pandani</em>, <em>A.albopictus</em>, <em>A. hensilli</em>, and <em>A. guamensis</em> (<a href="https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.7atvrc">GBIF database search</a>). <em>A.aegyti</em> was previously present, but this is one of the very few invasive species successfully eradicated from the island. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rattus"><em>Rattus</em> spp.</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mus_(genus)"><em>Mus</em> spp.</a> Five species of rodents in these genera are currently on Guam [1]: <em>R. exulans</em>, <em>R.norvegicus</em>, <em>R. rattus</em>, <em>R. tanezumi</em>, <em>M. musculus</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"><em>Felis catus</em></a>, domestic cats, are abundant on Guam in domestic and feral populations. However,  GBIF contains no Guam records for cats. [1]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="Coptotermes formosanus"><em>Coptotermes formosanus</em></a>, the Formosan subterranean termite, has been reported from Guam. However, a survey by Su and Sch found only C. gestroi (syn. C.vastator) and suggested that previous identifications of Guam specimens as C. formosanus were erroneous. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_imported_fire_ant"><em>Solenopsis invicta</em></a>, red imported fire ant, is not reported from Guam. geminata</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_tree_snake"><em>Boiga irregularis</em></a>, brown treesnake (BTS), is abundant on Guam.  Occurrence on Guam represents the only documented reproductive population outside the native range of this snake. BTS is unique in this figure as being the only taxon in which management costs exceed all other costs. Much of the BTS management costs are used used to to prevent accidental export BTS from Guam. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boll_weevil"><em>Anthonomus grandis</em></a>, cotton boll weevil, is not reported from Guam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lymantria_dispar"><em>Lymantria dispar</em></a>, European gypsy moth is nNot reported from Guam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bee"><em>Apis mellifera scutellata</em></a>, East African lowland honeybee, is a subspecies of the western honey bee which has been determined to constitute one part of the ancestry of the Africanized bees spreading through America. There is no record of <em>A. mellifera scutellata</em> on Guam and there is no evidence of Africanization of domestic or feral populations of <em>A. mellifera</em> on Guam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochliomyia_hominivorax"><em>Cochliomyia hominivorax</em></a>, New World screw-worm fly, is not reported from Guam.</p>
